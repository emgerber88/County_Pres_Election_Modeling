    "## Overview\n",
    "I was tasked with creating a model to predict which party will win more votes in a county in a United States presidential election based on various demographic features of that county. This model can be used by political parties to identify emerging counties of interest in the lead-up to an election to help guide their decisions on where to allocate advertising, field organizing, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used county-level demographic and presidential election data from the US Census Bureau and MIT Election Data + Science Lab that had been consolidated into a single dataset on Kaggle. The data included information from four presidential elections (2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020), each of which took place in a different national political context and with varying levels of national election turnout.\n",

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Despite winning three of the last four presidential elections, the Democratic Party in the United States faces a perilous political future. A [small number of states](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/politics/2022-preview-2024-presidential-election/index.html) hold the key to swinging any given presidential contest. The near-inverse results of the 2016 and 2020 elections in terms of total electoral college votes despite [small swings in the popular vote margins of these states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/president-2020/) demonstrates the importance of allocating campaign resources efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2020 election proved that the Democratic Party can return states it had lost in 2016 to its column (Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania) while simultaneously picking up new states for the first time since the 1990s (Arizona, Georgia). In order to protect these gains, and expand the electoral map to open new opportunities, the party must have an understanding of what factors make a state likely to tip to one party or the other in the coming years.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to conduct my analysis at the county level because while presidential elections are decided at the state level, political parties build operations (such as \"get out the vote\" efforts and digital advertising campaigns) that target voters at the most granular geographic level possible and need information to guide these decisions. Additionally, these predictions are only meant to be one piece of the puzzle - they can be put in the broader political context of the state and nation as part of the process of developing a comprehensive campaign strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "By building a predictive model to project the winner of presidential elections at the county level, the party can better understand what factors make a given area likely to vote one way or the other in coming elections. It can use this knowledge to guide its investments in emerging fertile areas or to shore up states that are at risk of slipping away."
